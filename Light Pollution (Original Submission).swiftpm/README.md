#  Light Pollution
> Submitted as part of **Apple WWDC23 Swift Student Challenge**.

## Introduction
As someone who loves to gaze at the stars, I've found that light pollution is an inconvenience. However, it's actually much more than that - light pollution has significant impacts that we should all be aware of.

In this playground, let's learn about this phenomenon together: what it is, why we should be concerned, and what we can do to mitigate it.

This playground consists of six main contents with interactive elements on each page with modular components to closely resembles real-life light pollution.

## Usage
This playground start from `MyApp.swift`.

It is **best viewed** on an `iPad Pro (12.9-inch)` in both portrait and landscape mode, and can also be run on `macOS Swift Playground 4.3`.

## Technology Used
1. SwiftUI
2. AVFoundation

## Assets
Graphic assets are created in `Figma` with inspiration from the Internet.
Audio assets are created with my light switch (edited on Audacity).

## Tools
1. XCode
2. Figma
3. Notion (For note-taking)
5. MacOS GarageBand
6. Audacity
6. My Light Switch :D

## Credits
This playground would not be complete without the contributions from the community. 
Credit for various resources used in this playground can be found inside the playground.

Additionally, I would like to give credits to the following:
- Apple Documentation
- Stack Overflow
- GitHub
- YouTube
- Forums
